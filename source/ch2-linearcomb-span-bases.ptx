  <title>Linear Combinations, Spanning, and Bases</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we have seen, there are ways we can describe a location in space whether it is viewed as a point or 
      a vector.  We have also seen how we can interpret these ideas through the lens of "different worlds" 
      where the representation has physical meaning to constructs from our everyday lives.  In this chapter, 
      we will look at these ideas from a more geometric perspective.  In particular, we will examine how we 
      can express the same geometric properties (or physical realities) using different types of coordinates 
      and vectors and still arrive at the same conclusions about the objects they are representing.  For 
      example, in a base-ten numeration system, the collection of symbols, <m>12</m>, means twelve 
      (one bundle of ten and two left over).  However, if we use, say base seven, we would express this as, 
      <m>15_{seven}</m>, meaning one bundle of seven with five left over.  No matter how we express it, 
      twelve is still twelve.  This same idea can be extended to how we describe the space we want to use 
      within a mathematical world.
