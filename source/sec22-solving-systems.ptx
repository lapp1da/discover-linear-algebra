  <title>Solving Systems of Equations</title>

  <p>
    In this section we will explore processes surrounding solving systems of linear equations.  In the last 
    section, we ended by experimenting with various scalars to determine if a set of vectors were linearly 
    independent.  Mostly we used trial and error or tried to reduce the linear combinations by chosing 
    a value for one of the scalars and then working backwards to find the remaining scalars.  This was a 
    time-consuming process and can often be challenging if there is a unique solution.  In this section, we 
    will try a more systematic approach that will help us find the desired scalars more efficiently.  
  </p>

    <title>Finding Scalars: Gaussian Elimination</title>
    
  <p>
    As we ended section 2.1, we wanted to establish whether or not a set of vectors was linealry independent.  
    To do this, we needed to determine whether or not we could find a set of scalar values that would give 
    us a linear combination for other vectors in the set.  In addition, we sought to determine the if a 
    vector was in the <term>Span</term> of a set of vectors.  For both of these questions, we ultimately 
    want to solve for specific scalars that would meet our desired requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    While this process of finding scalars may seem new, it is actually not a new idea.  Recall that in high 
    school we solved systems of equations using a variety of techniques including substitution, elimination, and 
    graphing.  As the number of variables and equations increased, the techniques of substitution and 
    graphing became very challenging.  The process of elimination was generally easier as the number of 
    variables increased and so this process is the one we will refine here.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may recall that there were certain operations we could perform on equations so that their solution 
    sets did not change.  These included multiplying an equation by a nonzero constant, adding equals to equals, 
    and rearranging the equations.  For example, since, say, <m>5=5</m>, we can also say that 
    <m>2\cdot5=2\cdot5</m>.  Similarly for an equation like <m>x+2y=5</m> (for which a solution is clearly 
    <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m>), then if we multiply both sides by, say 3, we get 
    <m>3\left(x+2y=5\right) \Rightarrow 3x+6y=3\cdot5\Rightarrow 3x+6y=15</m>.  Just as <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m> 
    is a solution to the original equation, due to the fact that multiplying both sides of an equation by the same 
    value gives a new equation that is also true, <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m> is also a solution to 
    <m>3x+6y=15</m> (i.e. <m>3\cdot1+6\cdot2=3+12=15</m>).
  </p>
  <p>
    In a similar fashion, if we start with <m>x+2y=5</m> and add the same amount to both sides, we get 
    <m>x+2y+7=5+7 \Rightarrow x+2y+7=12</m>.  If we plug in <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m> we get 
    <m>1+2\cdot2+7=1+4+7=12</m>.  In both cases, if we start with an equation with a certain solution, adding 
    the same constant to both sides or multiplying both sides by the same constant will give a new 
    equation for which the solution to the original equation will be a solution to the new equation.
  </p>
  <p>
    What if we want to add expressions to both sides of an equation?  Consider another equation, 
    <m>4x+y=6</m>, that also has a common solution, <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m>.  If we add this equation to 
    or earlier equation, <m>x+2y=5</m>, we get 
    <me>
      \begin{array} 3 x+2y=5\\4x+y=6\\\overline{5x+3y=11}\end{array}
    </me>
    where <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m> is still a solution to the result, <m>5x+3y=11</m> (see 
    <xref ref="three-lines"/>).  What this tells us is that if we seek solutions to a system of equations, 
    we can add any of the equations in the system to each other and get a new equation that also shares 
    the same solution(s) as the previous equations.

  </p>
  <p>
    So now suppose we did not know that the solution to our earlier set of equations, <m>x+2y=5</m> and 
    <m>4x+y=6</m>, was <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m>.  How do these manipulations that yield new equations with 
    the same solution help us?  As you may recall from your earlier mathematics experiences, we can take the 
    approach of trying to "eliminate" a variable from the system so that we can more easily solve for one of 
    the variables.  In this case, consider what would happen if we multipled the top equation by -4.  This 
    would give us
  </p>
  <p>
    <me>
      \begin{array} 3 -4(x+2y=5)\\4x+y=6\\\overline{5x+3y=11}\end{array}
      \Rightarrow
      \begin{array} 3 -4x-8y=-20\\4x+y=6\\\overline{0x-7y=-14}\end{array}
      \Rightarrow
      -7y=-14 \Rightarrow y=2
    </me>
    Now we can simply plug <m>y=2</m> into either of our original equations to get a value for <m>x</m>.  
    Let's use the first equation as it is easier to solve for <m>x</m>.  This gives <m>x+2\cdot2=5</m> which 
    yields <m>x+4=5 \Rightarrow x=1</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <example>
    <title>Finding Scalars</title>
    <p>
      Consider a more simple version of our scenario from Chapter 1 involving prices, <m>p</m> and revenue 
      <m>r</m> for products we are selling to various companies.  In this case, we consider fewer companies 
      and products to make this example easier to disect.  Suppose we have the following data for the number 
      of items for two different products for two different companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <table xml:id="product-orders-small">
      <title>Product Orders</title>
      <tabular halign="center">
      <row header="yes" bottom="minor">
        <cell>Clients</cell>
        <cell>Product 1</cell>
        <cell>Product 2</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Company 1</cell>
        <cell>2</cell>
        <cell>3</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Company 2</cell>
        <cell>1</cell>
        <cell>5</cell>
      </row>
  </tabular>
</table>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case we are looking for scalars for prices, <m>p_1</m> and <m>p_2</m>, that provide desired revenues, 
    <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m>.  This gives the following vector equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <me>
            p_1 \begin{bmatrix}
            2\\1\end{bmatrix} + p_2 \begin{bmatrix}
            3\\5\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            r_1\\r_2\end{bmatrix}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      A question we might ask is what prices do we need to set so that we have revenue of $43 from 
      Company 1 and $46 from Company 2?  It may be that there are no such price combinations that will 
      yield what we want (i.e. does this combination exist?).  There may be a case where there are 
      infinitely many such price combinations (i.e. there is not uniqueness).  These two fundamental 
      questions of <term>existence</term> and <term>uniqueness</term> will be ones we revisit as we seek 
      solutions to equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now we ask if we can find solutions to the vector equation, 
      <m>p_1 \begin{bmatrix}
            2\\1\end{bmatrix} + p_2 \begin{bmatrix}
            3\\5\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            43\\46\end{bmatrix}
      </m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this is not such an unusual task.  Recall from high algebra we solved these equations before, 
      but they were simply written in a different form.  This vector equation could also be written as 
      <me>
        2p_1+3p_2=43
      </me>
      <me>
        p_1+5p_2=46
      </me>
      
      
    </p>
    
    </example>
