  <title>Solving Systems of Equations</title>

  <p>
    In this section we will explore processes surrounding solving systems of linear equations.  In the last 
    section, we ended by experimenting with various scalars to determine if a set of vectors were linearly 
    independent.  Mostly we used trial and error or tried to reduce the linear combinations by chosing 
    a value for one of the scalars and then working backwards to find the remaining scalars.  This was a 
    time-consuming process and can often be challenging if there is a unique solution.  In this section, we 
    will try a more systematic approach that will help us find the desired scalars more efficiently.  
  </p>

    <title>Finding Scalars: Gaussian Elimination</title>
    
  <p>
    As we ended section 2.1, we wanted to establish whether or not a set of vectors was linealry independent.  
    To do this, we needed to determine whether or not we could find a set of scalar values that would give 
    us a linear combination for other vectors in the set.  In addition, we sought to determine the if a 
    vector was in the <term>Span</term> of a set of vectors.  For both of these questions, we ultimately 
    want to solve for specific scalars that would meet our desired requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    While this process of finding scalars may seem new, it is actually not a new idea.  Recall that in high 
    school we solved systems of equations using a variety of techniques including substitution, elimination, and 
    graphing.  As the number of variables and equations increased, the techniques of substitution and 
    graphing became very challenging.  The process of elimination was generally easier as the number of 
    variables increased and so this process is the one we will refine here.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may recall that there were certain operations we could perform on equations so that their solution 
    sets did not change.  These included multiplying an equation by a nonzero constant, adding equals to equals, 
    and rearranging the equations.  For example, since, say, <m>5=5</m>, we can also say that 
    <m>2\cdot5=2\cdot5</m>.  Similarly for an equation like <m>x+2y=5</m> (for which a solution is clearly 
    <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m>), then if we multiply both sides by, say 3, we get 
    <m>3\left(x+2y=5\right) \Rightarrow 3x+6y=3\cdot5\Rightarrow 3x+6y=15</m>.  Just as <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m> 
    is a solution to the original equation, due to the fact that multiplying both sides of an equation by the same 
    value gives a new equation that is also true, <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m> is also a solution to 
    <m>3x+6y=15</m> (i.e. <m>3\cdot1+6\cdot2=3+12=15</m>).
  </p>
  <p>
    In a similar fashion, if we start with <m>x+2y=5</m> and add the same amount to both sides, we get 
    <m>x+2y+7=5+7 \Rightarrow x+2y+7=12</m>.  If we plug in <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m> we get 
    <m>1+2\cdot2+7=1+4+7=12</m>.  In both cases, if we start with an equation with a certain solution, adding 
    the same constant to both sides or multiplying both sides by the same constant will give a new 
    equation for which the solution to the original equation will be a solution to the new equation.
  </p>
  <p>
    What if we want to add expressions to both sides of an equation?  Consider another equation, 
    <m>4x+y=6</m>, that also has a common solution, <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m>.  If we add this equation to 
    or earlier equation, <m>x+2y=5</m>, we get 
    <me>
      \begin{array} 3 x+2y=5\\4x+y=6\\\overline{5x+3y=11}\end{array}
    </me>
    where <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m> is still a solution to the result, <m>5x+3y=11</m> (see 
    <xref ref="three-lines"/>).  What this tells us is that if we seek solutions to a system of equations, 
    we can add any of the equations in the system to each other and get a new equation that also shares 
    the same solution(s) as the previous equations.
  </p>
  <p>
    <figure xml:id="three-lines">
      <caption>Three Lines</caption>
      <image source="images/three-lines.png" width="60%">
        <shortdescription>(for accessibility)</shortdescription>
      </image>
    </figure>
  </p>
  <p>
    So now suppose we did not know that the solution to our earlier set of equations, <m>x+2y=5</m> and 
    <m>4x+y=6</m>, was <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=2</m>.  How do these manipulations that yield new equations with 
    the same solution help us?  As you may recall from your earlier mathematics experiences, we can take the 
    approach of trying to "eliminate" a variable from the system so that we can more easily solve for one of 
    the variables.  In this case, consider what would happen if we multipled the top equation by -4.  This 
    would give us
  </p>
  <p>
    <me>
      \begin{array} 3 -4(x+2y=5)\\\quad 4x+\; y=6\\\overline{\quad 5x+3y=11}\end{array}
      \Rightarrow
      \begin{array} 3 \quad -4x-8y=-20\\ \quad\;\; 4x+\;\, y=\quad\; 6\\ \quad \overline{\quad 0x-7y=-14}\end{array}
      \Rightarrow
      -7y=-14 \Rightarrow y=2
    </me>
    Now we can simply plug <m>y=2</m> into either of our original equations to get a value for <m>x</m>.  
    Let's use the first equation as it is easier to solve for <m>x</m>.  This gives <m>x+2\cdot2=5</m> which 
    yields <m>x+4=5 \Rightarrow x=1</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <example>
    <title>Finding Scalars</title>
    <p>
      Consider a more simplified version of our scenario from Chapter 1 involving prices, <m>p</m> and revenue 
      <m>r</m> for products we are selling to various companies.  In this case, we consider fewer companies 
      and products to make this example easier to disect.  Suppose we have the following data for the number 
      of items for two different products for two different companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <table xml:id="product-orders-small">
      <title>Product Orders</title>
      <tabular halign="center">
      <row header="yes" bottom="minor">
        <cell>Clients</cell>
        <cell>Product 1</cell>
        <cell>Product 2</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Company 1</cell>
        <cell>2</cell>
        <cell>3</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Company 2</cell>
        <cell>1</cell>
        <cell>5</cell>
      </row>
  </tabular>
</table>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case we are looking for scalars for prices, <m>p_1</m> and <m>p_2</m>, that provide desired revenues, 
    <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m>.  This gives the following vector equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <me>
            p_1 \begin{bmatrix}
            2\\1\end{bmatrix} + p_2 \begin{bmatrix}
            3\\5\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            r_1\\r_2\end{bmatrix}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      A question we might ask is what prices do we need to set so that we have revenue of $43 from 
      Company 1 and $46 from Company 2?  It may be that there are no such price combinations that will 
      yield what we want (i.e. does this combination exist?).  There may be a case where there are 
      infinitely many such price combinations (i.e. there is not uniqueness).  These two fundamental 
      questions of <term>existence</term> and <term>uniqueness</term> will be ones we revisit as we seek 
      solutions to equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now we ask if we can find solutions to the vector equation, 
      <m>p_1 \begin{bmatrix}
            2\\1\end{bmatrix} + p_2 \begin{bmatrix}
            3\\5\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            43\\46\end{bmatrix}
      </m>?
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this is not such an unusual task.  Recall from high algebra we solved these equations before, 
      but they were simply written in a different form.  This vector equation could also be written as 
      <me>
        2p_1+3p_2=43
      </me>
      <me>
        p_1+5p_2=46
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we can use the process of Gaussian elimination to reduce these equations to only one variable.  Suppose 
      we multiply the second equation by <m>-2</m> and add the resulting equations to obtain the following.
    </p>
    <p>
      <me>
        \begin{array} 2 \quad 2p_1+3p_2=43\\ -2(p_1+ 5p_2=46)\end{array}
        \Rightarrow
        \begin{array} 3 \quad 2p_1+3p_2=\quad 43\\ -2p_1-10p_2= -92\\
        \overline{\quad 0p_1- \; 7p_2=-49}\end{array}
        \Rightarrow
        -7p_2=-49 \Rightarrow p_2=7
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we can use our value for <m>p_2=7</m> in one of our original equations (let's use the second one 
      since it is easier) to get <m>p_1+5\cdot7=46</m> which gives <m>p_1=46-35=11</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Checking this result we get 
      <m>11\cdot \begin{bmatrix}
        2\\1\end{bmatrix} + 7\cdot \begin{bmatrix}
        3\\5\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
        43\\46\end{bmatrix}
      </m>.
    </p>

    As you may have noticed in both of these examples for solving a system with Gaussian elimination, to make 
    it easier to manipulate and perform operations on the equations, we made it a practice to keep the 
    variables aligned with each other and then performed the multiplication by scalars and addition of 
    equations.  This helped us make sure we were not accidently adding the coefficients of different variables 
    together.  For the most part, this practice just makes "bookkeeping" easier.  This should sound kind of 
    familiar.  We did the same thing in Chapter 1 when we introduced vectors and matrices.  We viewed these 
    arrays of elements as an easier way to keep track of corresponding components that represented values for 
    the same type of quantities (e.g. orders of the same product, price of the same product, revenue from 
    the same company) without needing to label them.  So the natural question is, do we need to write the 
    variable name if we already know which variable is associated with which column in our "stacked" 
    representation of the equations?  The answer is a resounding, no!  So let's consider what would happen if 
    we were to forego the writing of the variable names.

    When we look at the general structure we have been using for our equations in the Guassian elimination 
    process, we wanted our equations to be of the form like <m>5x_1+3x_2+2x_3=-7</m> where the variables are 
    all on the left side of the equation and the right side contains only a numerical value.  If we assume this 
    structure of our equations, we can define them in the following way.

  <definition xml:id="def-linear-equations">

        A <term>linear equation</term> in the variables, <m>x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n</m> may be written in
