  <title>Applications for Systems of Linear Equations</title>

  <p>
    In this section we will explore processes surrounding solving systems of linear equations.  In the last 
    section, we ended by experimenting with various scalars to determine if a set of vectors were linearly 
    independent.  Mostly we used trial and error or tried to reduce the linear combinations by chosing 
    a value for one of the scalars and then working backwards to find the remaining scalars.  This was a 
    time-consuming process and can often be challenging if there is a unique solution.  In this section, we 
    will try a more systematic approach that will help us find the desired scalars more efficiently.  In addtion, 
    the techniques we will develop will also help us solve general systems of linear equations as they arise 
    in real-world scenarios.
