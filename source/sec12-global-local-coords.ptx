  <title>Global vs Local Coordinates</title>
  <introduction>  
  <p>
    In this section we will look at how we can describe locations from within a small 
    region around us and within the a larger space where our small world might exist. Believe it or not, we use 
    this idea on a daily basis.  If you have ever written a paper that included images, your computer used 
    "small-world" locations and placed them within a "larger-world" context.  Consider the image below of a 
    local image <xref ref="fig-3d-system-local"/> and a page of text where this image has been placed 
    <xref ref="fig-3d-system-on-page"/> (a global coordinate system).

    Imagine that I am wanting to write a book (which I am) and wish to have a figure imbedded within the 
    text that is being written.  The image is created as a series of pixels that are defined by specific 
    colors in an array within a “local” environment where the pixels represent coordinates (or points) for 
    each part of the image.  The image is then inserted into a much wider defined document with its own set of 
    coordinates.  The placement of the image means that the old coordinates must be converted (or transformed) 
    into the new coordinates that exist within the larger image (i.e. the page).  We can even wrap text around 
    the image if we are feeling fancy.  In addition, we may also want to scale the image up or down to fit a 
    particular format for the page.  This means that the original coordinates for the image must be 
    transformed again.  So how can we use mathematics to accomplish these transformations?
