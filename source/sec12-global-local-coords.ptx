  <title>Global vs Local Coordinates</title>
  <introduction>  
  <p>
    In this section we will look at how we can describe locations from within a small 
    region around us and within the a larger space where our small world might exist. Believe it or not, we use 
    this idea on a daily basis.  If you have ever written a paper that included images, your computer used 
    "small-world" locations and placed them within a "larger-world" context.  Consider the image below of a 
    local image <xref ref="fig-3d-system-local"/> and a page of text where this image has been placed 
    <xref ref="fig-3d-system-on-page"/> (a global coordinate system).
