      I want to dedicate this text to my wonderful wife, Kim, whose sacrifices and support have always 
      made my professional goals possible.  She was willing to limit her own professional ambitions to 
      accommodate my needs.  Thank you and I love you!
    </p>
    <p>
      I also want to thank my kids, Noah, Ellen, and Sarah, for being my inspiration in the teaching and 
      learning of mathematics.  For two of them, I had the pleasure of actually being their professor and 
      they have given me insights into how students learn mathematics.  They all have been supportive of my 
      professional life.  I love you all!

    This book is an application of research I have conducted on the teaching and learning of linear 
    algebra with my colleagues and friends, the late Dr. Melvin Nyman from Alma College, and 
    Dr. John Berry of the University of Plymouth in the UK.  As we conducted research together on students in 
    linear algebra classes, I so valued our stimulating conversations and genuine friendship.  I could 
    not have created this text without the insights they shared as we analyzed our data and crafted our 
    journal articles.  As Mel was only a few miles away from Central Michigan University, I truly miss 
    my frequent visits to his campus.  While Mel is no longer with us, his influence on my thinking and 
    teaching are still an ever present reminder of a great friend and mathematician.  While John is still 
    active in working to inspire the mathematically talented youth of the UK, I do miss the opportunity 
    to engage with him for the sake of my own professional development.  His ideas always prompted deeper 
    understanding for me and I cherish our work together.
