  <title>Coordinates, Vectors, and Linear Combinations</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Imagine you are standing in an unfamiliar forest and seeking a way out.  
    You can see the sun and know the approximate time of day and know that your parked 
    car is on the northmost edge of the forest.  How do you navigate your way toward your car?  
    Do you need to know your exact location or do you simply need to identify a direction you 
    need to go from your current location? </p>
