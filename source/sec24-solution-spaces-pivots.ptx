  <title>Describing Solution Spaces and Pivotal Influence</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    In this section we use the reduced row echelon form and the location of pivots to describe the solution 
    spaces for systems of equations.  These locations of pivots will also be "pivotal" for determining the 
    vectors that are essential for spanning a space.

    <title>Consistent and Inconsistent Systems</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="prop-possible-solution-types"/> gave us three scenarios that can happen with linear systems of 
      equations.  The first two deal with when we <em>have</em> solutions (either a unique solution or infinitely many 
      solutions).  In the case where solutions exist, we call the system <term>consistent</term>.  In the case 
      where there are no solutions, we say that the system is <term>inconsistent</term>.  You may recall these 
      scenarios from <xref ref="act-system-solve-infinite-solutions"/> with 
      <xref ref="3d-system-infinite-solution"/> and <xref ref="act-system-solve-no-solutions"/> 
      with <xref ref="3d-system-no-solution"/> where in one case you could place a point in 
      <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> so that it existed in all three planes at once and in the other case it was not 
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
    When looking to determine whether a system of equations is consistent or inconsistent, it would be nice to 
    have a simple way to examine its corresponding matrix and know the type of system we have.  To explore this 
    question, consider the following activity.

              Consider the following augmented matrices

              <me>
              \left[

              \left[

              1 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 3
             \end{array}

              Place these in reduced row echelon form and locate the pivots of each matrix.  Use your 
              <m>\mathbf{rref}</m> command on your CAS for this.  Determine if the system of equations 
              represented by these matrices are consistent or inconsistent.

          <statement>
            <p>
              Notice that each of the reduced row echelon forms of these matrices has a row consisting of all 
              zeros.  Does the presence of an all zero row influence whether or not the system is consistent 
              or inconsistent?  Explain your reasoning.

        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              In looking at the reduced row echelon form of the three matrices, are there any forms that lead 
              you to believe that system is inconsistent?  Place your observations into a conjecture for 
              using the pivot positions of the reduced row echelon form of an augmented matrix as a means of 
              determining that a system is inconsistent.

      </activity>
    </p>
    <p>
    The nature of solutions we noticed in <xref ref="prop-possible-solution-types"/> has a direct connection to 
    the pivot locations from the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix created for the system of 
    equations we are trying to solve.
