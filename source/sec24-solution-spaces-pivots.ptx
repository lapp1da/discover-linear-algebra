  <title>Describing Solution Spaces and Pivotal Influence</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    In this section we use the reduced row echelon form and the location of pivots to describe the solution 
    spaces for systems of equations.  These locations of pivots will also be "pivotal" for determining the 
    vectors that are essential for spanning a space.

    <title>Consistent and Inconsistent Systems</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="prop-possible-solution-types"/> gave us three scenarios that can happen with linear systems of 
      equations.  The first two deal with when we <em>have</em> solutions (either a unique solution or infinitely many 
      solutions).  In the case where solutions exist, we call the system <term>consistent</term>.  In the case 
      where there are no solutions, we say that the system is <term>inconsistent</term>.  You may recall these 
      scenarios from <xref ref="act-system-solve-infinite-solutions"/> with 
      <xref ref="3d-system-infinite-solution"/> and <xref ref="act-system-solve-no-solutions"/> 
      with <xref ref="3d-system-no-solution"/> where in one case you could place a point in 
      <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> so that it existed in all three planes at once and in the other case it was not 
      possible to have a point that existed in all three planes.  So when it comes to solutions to systems of 
      equations, we deal with the two fundamental questions of <em>existence</em> and <em>uniqueness</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
    When looking to determine whether a system of equations is consistent or inconsistent, it would be nice to 
    have a simple way to examine its corresponding matrix and know the type of system we have.  To explore this 
    question, consider the following activity.

              In looking at the reduced row echelon form of the three matrices, are there any forms that lead 
              you to believe that system is inconsistent?  Place your observations into a conjecture for 
              using the pivot positions of the reduced row echelon form of an augmented matrix as a means of 
              determining that a system is inconsistent.

    The nature of solutions we noticed in <xref ref="prop-possible-solution-types"/> has a direct connection to

  <title>Pivots, Consistency, and Uniqueness</title>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="def-reduced-row-echelon-form"/>, we alluded to the term <term>pivot</term> with respect to 
    leading entries in the reduced row echelon form of a matrix.  Here we will expand on this idea since we want 
    to explore connections between pivots and the solutions to systems of equations.  In particular, how might 
    pivots help us identify free variables in a system and use them to generate the infinitely many solutions 
    that might exist for a system?  To this end, let's formalize what we mean by a <term>pivot position</term>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <definition xml:id="def-pivot-position">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>pivot position</term> for matrix, <m>A</m>, is a position of a leading entry in the 
          reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
  </p>

  <p>
    In the study of linear algebra, a fundamental concept for understanding the structure and properties of 
    matrices and systems of linear equations is that of pivot positions. Some of the purposes of identifying pivot 
    positions is to gain insight into the <term>rank</term> of a matrix, the solvability of linear systems, 
    and the <term>basis</term> of vector spaces. We will discuss <term>basis</term> later in chapter 3, but 
    for now we will examine connections to solvability of systems.  These positions are key to the process of 
    Gaussian elimination and row reduction as we have seen, which are standard algorithms for simplifying 
    matrices into more manageable forms.
  </p>

  <p>
    The term "<em>pivot</em>" itself originates from the idea of a central or critical point around which other 
    elements are organized or rotated. In the context of a matrix, a pivot position acts as such a central point. 
    During the process of row reduction, we systematically eliminate entries below and/or above certain leading 
    entries. These leading entries are precisely what we call pivots.  In <xref ref="act-matrix-reduce-rref"/>, 
    you noticed that there comes a point where your reduction of a matrix is limited and you cannot affect 
    changes to some rows without messing up zeros we have already placed in other rows.  The pivot in a row will 
    allow us to reduce all entries above and below it to zero while not changing any entries that occur in columns 
    where there are zeros to the left of the pivot position.  Since there are only zeros to the left of a pivot, 
    the use of that pivot row in the row reduction process to reduce other rows will not affect the entries in 
    the same column as those zeros for the other rows because we will simply be adding zero to those entries.  
    This gives us a way to manipulate pivot column entries while leaving other columns alone (provided those 
    columns are the columns where there are zeros in the row being used).  
  </p>

  <p>
    As defined in <xref ref="def-pivot-position" />, a pivot position in a matrix refers to the location of a 
    leading entry (the first non-zero entry) in a row of its row echelon form. When a matrix is transformed 
    through elementary row operations into row echelon form, the non-zero rows will each have a unique leading 
    entry. The column containing this leading entry is then called a <term>pivot column</term>. The number of 
    pivot positions in a matrix is equal to its <term>rank</term>, which signifies the maximum number of 
    linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix. This concept is crucial because it directly relates 
    to the dimension of the <term>column space</term> and <term>row space</term> of the matrix, providing 
    essential information about the underlying linear transformations and vector spaces associated with the matrix.
  </p>

  <p>
    The term <term>rank</term> has its origins in military formations.  In military echelon formations on the 
    battlefield, ranks are a structured hierarchy, with various officers and enlisted personnel leading units 
    at different levels. Echelon formation is a tactical arrangement where units are staggered diagonally, 
    allowing for maneuverability and visibility.  Since our reduced row matrices have this staggered structure 
    (if you ignore the presence of the zeros to the left of pivots), it makes sense why the term <term>rank</term> 
    is used to identify how many linearly independent rows or columns as these are essentially the number of 
    what would be the ranking officers in the battlefield formations.  The word <em>echelon</em> also comes from 
    military terminology.
