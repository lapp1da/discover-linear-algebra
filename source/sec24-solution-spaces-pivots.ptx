  <title>Describing Solution Spaces and Pivotal Influence</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    In this section we use the reduced row echelon form and the location of pivots to describe the solution 
    spaces for systems of equations.  These locations of pivots will also be "pivotal" for determining the 
    vectors that are essential for spanning a space.

    <title>Consistent and Inconsistent Systems</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="prop-possible-solution-types"/> gave us three scenarios that can happen with linear systems of 
      equations.  The first two deal with when we <em>have</em> solutions (either a unique solution or infinitely many 
      solutions).  In the case where solutions exist, we call the system <term>consistent</term>.  In the case 
      where there are no solutions, we say that the system is <term>inconsistent</term>.  You may recall these 
      scenarios from <xref ref="act-system-solve-infinite-solutions"/> with 
      <xref ref="3d-system-infinite-solution"/> and <xref ref="act-system-solve-no-solutions"/> 
      with <xref ref="3d-system-no-solution"/> where in one case you could place a point in 
      <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> so that it existed in all three planes at once and in the other case it was not 
      possible to have a point that existed in all three planes.  So when it comes to solutions to systems of 
      equations, we deal with the two fundamental questions of <em>existence</em> and <em>uniqueness</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
    When looking to determine whether a system of equations is consistent or inconsistent, it would be nice to 
    have a simple way to examine its corresponding matrix and know the type of system we have.  To explore this 
    question, consider the following activity.

              In looking at the reduced row echelon form of the three matrices, are there any forms that lead 
              you to believe that system is inconsistent?  Place your observations into a conjecture for 
              using the pivot positions of the reduced row echelon form of an augmented matrix as a means of 
              determining that a system is inconsistent.

    The nature of solutions we noticed in <xref ref="prop-possible-solution-types"/> has a direct connection to 
    the pivot locations from the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix created for the system of

  <title>Pivots, Consistency, and Uniqueness</title>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="def-reduced-row-echelon-form"/>, we alluded to the term <term>pivot</term> with respect to 
    leading entries in the reduced row echelon form of a matrix.  Here we will expand on this idea since we want 
    to explore connections between pivots and the solutions to systems of equations.  In particular, how might 
    pivots help us identify free variables in a system and use them to generate the infinitely many solutions 
    that might exist for the system?  To this end, let's formalize what we mean by a <term>pivot position</term>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <definition xml:id="def-pivot-position">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>pivot position</term> for matrix, <m>A</m>, is a position of a leading entry in the 
          reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
  </p>

  <p>
    In the study of linear algebra, a fundamental concept for understanding the structure and properties of 
    matrices and systems of linear equations is that of pivot positions. The purpose of identifying pivot 
    positions is to gain insight into the <term>rank</term> of a matrix, the solvability of linear systems, 
    and the <term>basis</term> of vector spaces. We will discuss <term>basis</term> in chapter 3.  These 
    positions are key to the process of Gaussian elimination and row reduction as we have seen, which are 
    standard algorithms for simplifying matrices into more manageable forms.
  </p>

  <p>
    The term "pivot" itself originates from the idea of a central or critical point around which other 
    elements are organized or rotated. In the context of a matrix, a pivot position acts as such a point. 
    During the process of row reduction, an algorithm used to transform a matrix into row echelon form or 
    reduced row echelon form, we systematically eliminate entries below and/or above certain leading entries. 
    These leading entries are precisely what we call pivots.
  </p>

  <p>
    As defined in <xref ref="def-pivot-position" />, a pivot position in a matrix refers to the location of a 
    leading entry (the first non-zero entry) in a row of its row echelon form. When a matrix is transformed 
    through elementary row operations into row echelon form, the non-zero rows will each have a unique leading 
    entry. The column containing this leading entry is then called a <term>pivot column</term>. The number of 
    pivot positions in a matrix is equal to its <term>rank</term>, which signifies the maximum number of 
    linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix. This concept is crucial because it directly relates 
    to the dimension of the <term>column space</term> and <term>row space</term> of the matrix, providing 
    essential information about the underlying linear transformations and vector spaces associated with the matrix.
