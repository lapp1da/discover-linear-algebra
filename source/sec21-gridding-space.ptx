  <title>Gridding the Space</title>

  <p>
    In this section we will look at how a space can be described by many different types of 
    of coordinates and coordinate systems. As students, our first introduction to locating a point in the plane,
    <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>, is by imagining a square grid and expressing the location of a point as a pairing of 
    two coordinates, <m>\left(x,y\right)</m>.  As the story goes, the mathematician, Descartes, was watching a 
    fly walking on the ceiling.  He wondered how he might describe the position of the fly and decided that he 
    could measure the distance from the corner of the ceiling in one direction and then the distance along a 
    perpendicular direction to uniquely locate the fly.  This was the beginning of the Cartesian (or rectangular) 
    coordinate system.  However, this is not the only way we could uniquely locate the fly.

      Suppose you are Descartes staring at the fly on the ceiling.  At first, all you see is the fly sitting 
      arbitrarily in space (see Figure 2.1.2).  Next, you imagine two vectors defining different directions and 
      acting as units of measure (Figure 2.1.3).  As your imagination wanders, you begin to see two sets of 
      parallel lines crisscrossing the ceiling (Figure 2.1.4).

    <statement>
      <p>
        If the vectors, <m>\mathbf{v_1}</m> and <m>\mathbf{v_2}</m>, represent the units of measure in their 
        respective directions, and where these two vectors both begin is the origin of your grid system, 
        what would be the coordinates of the fly in the <m>\left\{\mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2}\right\}</m> 
        coordinate system?
