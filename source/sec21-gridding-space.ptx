  <title>Gridding the Space</title>

  <p>
    In this section we will look at how a space can be described by many different types of 
    of coordinates and coordinate systems. As students, our first introduction to locating a point in the plane,
    <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>, is by imagining a square grid and expressing the location of a point as a pairing of 
    two coordinates, <m>\left(x,y\right)</m>.  As the story goes, the mathematician, Descartes, was watching a 
    fly walking on the ceiling.  He wondered how he might describe the position of the fly and decided that he 
    could measure the distance from the corner of the ceiling in one direction and then the distance along a 
    perpendicular direction to uniquely locate the fly.  This was the beginning of the Cartesian (or rectangular) 
    coordinate system.  However, this is not the only way we could uniquely locate the fly.

    <p>
      Suppose you are Descartes staring at the fly on the ceiling.  At first, all you see is the fly sitting 
      arbitrarily in space (see Figure 2.1.2).  Next, you imagine two vectors defining different directions and 
      acting as units of measure (Figure 2.1.3).  As your imagination wanders, you begin to see two sets of 
      parallel lines crisscrossing the ceiling (Figure 2.1.4).

        If the vectors, <m>\mathbf{v_1}</m> and <m>\mathbf{v_2}</m>, represent the units of measure in their 
        respective directions, and where these two vectors both begin is the origin of your grid system, 
        what would be the coordinates of the fly in the <m>\left\{\mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2}\right\}</m>

    As we have just seen, there are several (in fact, infinitely many) ways we could grid the space to 
    describe a way to get to a location in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>.  We happened to be using two vectors in each 
    case in the previous activity, one with <m>\mathbf{v}_1</m> and <m>\mathbf{v}_2</m>, and the other with 
    vectors from our more familiar "standard" two vectors, <m>\mathbf{e}_1</m> and <m>\mathbf{e}_2</m>.  
    However, could we go with fewer vectors?  What about using more than two?  Let's consider what might 
    happen in either of these cases.

  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we have seen by the operations we have defined for vectors, we can create new vectors using 
      combinations of scalar multiplication and addition of existing vectors.  In this lab you will explore 
      both the algebraic and geometric combination of such vectors and develop an intuition for how 
      algebraic operations relate to geometric representations of the same ideas.

          This interactive construction provides, initially, two vectors displayed head-to-toe representing 
          a linear combination.  The numerical entries for each vector can be changed by simply editing 
          their respective values in the fields provided.  For eaxample, to change vector <m>\mathbf{v}</m>, 
          edit the values for <m>v_{1}</m> and <m>v_{2}</m>.  In addition, there are sliders provided for 
          the scalars associated with the vectors.  Manipulating the vectors and scalars allows you to create 
          various linear combinations using the displayed vectors.  Later in the project, you will be asked 
          to use three vectors instead of two.  To add the third vector, simply click the "three vectors" checkbox.

    If we start with a certain set of fixed vectors and look at all of the vectors we can get (or reach) 
    with just linear combinations of these vectors (<m>a\mathbf{v}+b\mathbf{w}</m>), it is like asking what 
    objects can we grab with our arms?  Thus we call the set of all vectors that we can reach with linear 
    combinations of a certain set of vectors the <term>Span</term> of those vectors (analogous to our 
    “arm span”).  In this case we would denote the set of all vectors that we can obtain from linear 
    combinations of <m>\mathbf{v}</m> and <m>\mathbf{w}</m> by <m>Span\left\{\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\right\}</m>.

  <title>Linear Independence</title>
  <p>
    As we saw in Project 2.1.2, we had a few different situations that could occur in dealing with vectors in 
    <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>.  If we only have one vector, it is easily seen that we can only move along a single 
    line containing that vector by use of scalar multiples of it.  If we have exactly two vectors, we can have 
    a couple of scenarios.  The first happens when the two vectors are just scalar multiples of each other.  
    In this case, adding them together in any linear combination will simply result in staying on the same 
    line, and thus, we cannot move into other parts of the <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> plane.  We can't get off the 
    line.  The second scenario is if we have two vectors that are not scalar multiples of each other.  In this 
    case, using scalar multiples of one of them allows us to move along an infinite line and when adding a 
    scalar multiple of the other vector, we can veer off that course into other regions of the 
    <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> plane.  In fact, to span all of <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>, we need to have at least two 
    vectors that are not scalar multiples of each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last scenario is when we had more than two vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>.  Recall that in this case, 
    we could replace some of these vectors with a single vector representing their sum and thus "reduce" the 
    number of vectors we needed to span the same space.  To see how this works algebraically, let's 
    explore it with some actual vectors.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          Based on Project 2.1.2, we noticed that if we are in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>, if we want to span 
          the entire space, we need to have at least two vectors.  However, it was not enough to have two 
          vectors, but in addition, these two vectors could not be on the same line.  Here we will explore 
          this idea in greater detail.  Consider the set of vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> given by 
          <m>\left\{\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\end{bmatrix},
          \begin{bmatrix}1\\3\end{bmatrix},

            Now replace the part of your linear combination, <m>1\cdot\begin{bmatrix}2\\6\end{bmatrix}</m>, 
            with its equivalent expression in terms of <m>\begin{bmatrix}1\\3\end{bmatrix}</m>.  Based on 
            your experience working with polynomials in high school, "factor out" the vector 
            <m>\begin{bmatrix}1\\3\end{bmatrix}</m> from the last two terms of your linear combination.  
            What is the new scalar you get for <m>\begin{bmatrix}1\\3\end{bmatrix}</m>?

            Now you can take your original linear combination in three vectors given by 
            <m>5\cdot\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\end{bmatrix}+
          6\cdot\begin{bmatrix}1\\3\end{bmatrix}-
          1\cdot\begin{bmatrix}2\\6\end{bmatrix}</m> and replace it with a linear combination of only two 
          vectors, namely <m>\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\end{bmatrix}</m> and <m>\begin{bmatrix}1\\3\end{bmatrix}</m>.  
          What is this linear combination?

            Using your CAS, evaluate both <m>5\cdot\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\end{bmatrix}+
            6\cdot\begin{bmatrix}1\\3\end{bmatrix}-1\cdot\begin{bmatrix}2\\6\end{bmatrix}</m> and your new 
            linear combination from part (d) to show they are the same.

    In the previous case, we happened to have one vector that was a scalar multiple of another vector, but what 
    happens if none of the three vectors are scalar multiples of another one of the three?  Suppose instead, 
    that one of the vectors is a linear combination of the other two?  Consider the set of three vectors 
    <m>\left\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3\right\}</m>.  Here we do not necessarily have one that is 
    a scalar multiple of another, but let's say that <m>\mathbf{v}_3=\alpha\mathbf{v}_1+\beta\mathbf{v}_2</m>.  
    Since our assumption here is that none of the three vectors is a scalar multiple of any of the remaining 
    ones, we can pick any two vectors and reach any other vector in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> since they do not fall 
    on the same line and thus will span all of the plane.  Therefore, we can assume that one of the three 
    vectors must be a linear combination of the other two.  If we want to have a particular linear combination 
    using all three vectors, <m>a\mathbf{v}_1+b\mathbf{v}_2+c\mathbf{v}_3</m>, we can instead represent this as 
    <m>a\mathbf{v}_1+b\mathbf{v}_2+c\left(\alpha\mathbf{v}_1+\beta\mathbf{v}_2\right)</m>.  This gives 
    <m>a\mathbf{v}_1+b\mathbf{v}_2+c\alpha\mathbf{v}_1+c\beta\mathbf{v}_2=
    \left(a+c\alpha\right)\mathbf{v}_1+\left(b+c\beta\right)\mathbf{v}_2</m>.  In otherwords, a linear 
    combination using just <m>\mathbf{v}_1</m> and <m>\mathbf{v}_2</m> meaning we only need two vectors since 
    one of the three is linearly <em>dependent</em> on the other two.  Since we can use this argument for all 
    three vectors, this also confirms your observations from Project 2.1.2 that given three vectors where no 
    two share a common line, a linear combination used to reach another vector is not unique.
