  <title>Gridding the Space</title>

  <p>
    In this section we will look at how a space can be described by many different types of 
    of coordinates and coordinate systems. As students, our first introduction to locating a point in the plane,
    <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>, is by imagining a square grid and expressing the location of a point as a pairing of 
    two coordinates, <m>\left(x,y\right)</m>.  As the story goes, the mathematician, Descartes, was watching a 
    fly walking on the ceiling.  He wondered how he might describe the position of the fly and decided that he 
    could measure the distance from the corner of the ceiling in one direction and then the distance along a 
    perpendicular direction to uniquely locate the fly.  This was the beginning of the Cartesian (or rectangular) 
    coordinate system.  However, this is not the only way we could uniquely locate the fly.

    <p>
      Suppose you are Descartes staring at the fly on the ceiling.  At first, all you see is the fly sitting 
      arbitrarily in space (see Figure 2.1.2).  Next, you imagine two vectors defining different directions and 
      acting as units of measure (Figure 2.1.3).  As your imagination wanders, you begin to see two sets of 
      parallel lines crisscrossing the ceiling (Figure 2.1.4).

        If the vectors, <m>\mathbf{v_1}</m> and <m>\mathbf{v_2}</m>, represent the units of measure in their 
        respective directions, and where these two vectors both begin is the origin of your grid system, 
        what would be the coordinates of the fly in the <m>\left\{\mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2}\right\}</m> 
        coordinate system?

      <p>
        Draw a vector from the origin (where <m>\mathbf{v}_1</m> and <m>\mathbf{v}_2</m> meet) to the fly.  
        Describe this new resultant vector as a linear combination of the vectors

        At this point you blink your eyes and imagine a new pair of vectors acting as your measuring 
        devices.  This time they are the standard unit vectors you are used to seeing from the Cartesian 
        plane, namely, <m>\mathbf{e}_1=\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}</m> and 
        <m>\mathbf{e}_2=\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}</m>.  Based on the grid system you see in 
        Figure 2.1.6, what are the coordinates of the fly's location?

    As we have just seen, there are several (in fact, infinitely many) ways we could grid the space to 
    describe a way to get to a location in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>.  We happened to be using two vectors in each 
    case in the previous activity, one with <m>\mathbf{v}_1</m> and <m>\mathbf{v}_2</m>, and the other with 
    vectors from our more familiar "standard" two vectors, <m>\mathbf{e}_1</m> and <m>\mathbf{e}_2</m>.  
    However, could we go with fewer vectors?  What about using more than two?  Let's consider what might 
    happen in either of these cases.

  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we have seen by the operations we have defined for vectors, we can create new vectors using 
      combinations of scalar multiplication and addition of existing vectors.  In this lab you will explore 
      both the algebraic and geometric combination of such vectors and develop an intuition for how 
      algebraic operations relate to geometric representations of the same ideas.

      <p>
        Consider the two vectors <m>\mathbf{v}=\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}</m> and 
        <m>\mathbf{w}=\begin{bmatrix}3\\1\end{bmatrix}</m>.  On page 1.1 of the document LinearComb.tns, 
        these vectors have been defined for you.  On page 1.2, you will see two sliders representing scalars 
        (<m>a</m> and <m>b</m>) along with the geometric representation of the linear combination of these 
        vectors using the scalar values (i.e. <m>a\mathbf{v}+b\mathbf{w}</m>).
      </p>
      <p>
        On page 1.2, adjust the sliders to find scalars <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> so that the linear combination 
        of the vectors <m>a\mathbf{v}</m> and <m>b\mathbf{w}</m> will be the same as the vector 
        <m>\begin{bmatrix}9.4\\6.4\end{bmatrix}</m>.  Record the values of the scalars you find giving 
        a rough sketch of your linear combination.
      </p>
    </statement>

        Don't worry if your decimal answers are a little off here.  It should, however, be in the ballpark.

        On page 1.1, perform the computation

        Is it possible to find a different pair of values <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> that will also result

        <m>\begin{bmatrix}9.4\\6.4\end{bmatrix}</m>?  If so, what values for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> did you

<introduction>
  <p>
    If we start with a certain set of fixed vectors and look at all of the vectors we can get (or reach) 
    with just linear combinations of these vectors (<m>a\mathbf{v}+b\mathbf{w}</m>), it is like asking what 
    objects can we grab with our arms?  Thus we call the set of all vectors that we can reach with linear 
    combinations of a certain set of vectors the <m>\mathbf{Span}</m> of those vectors (analogous to our 
    “arm span”).  In this case we would denote the set of all vectors that we can obtain from linear 
    combinations of <m>\mathbf{v}</m> and <m>\mathbf{w}</m> by <m>Span\left\{\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\right\}</m>.
