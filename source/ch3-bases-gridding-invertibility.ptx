  <title>Bases, Invertibility, and Gridding of Space</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In Chapter 2 we saw that there are many ways we can describe a location in space using vectors as 
      measuring units.  We have also seen how we can interpret the same location through the lens of "different 
      worlds of representation" where the representation is tied to the symbol system we use to "measure" the 
      location.  The object is still in the same place, but the way we represent the location is dependent on 
      the vectors we choose to use as a grid system.  In this chapter, we will look at this idea using 
      different types of coordinates and vectors and still arrive at the same conclusions about the objects 
      we are describing.
