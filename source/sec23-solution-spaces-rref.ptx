  <title>Solution Spaces and Reduced Row Echelon Form</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    In this section we will expand on the process for solving systems of equations using matrices and try to 
    characterize the structure of the reduced matrix as it relates to solutions to the system.

    <title>Matrices and Solution Spaces</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the last section, it seemed that when we had a system of 3 equations and 3 unknowns, the solution was 
      always unique.  Note that we have already seen, uniqueness is not always guaranteed (see 
      <xref ref="linear-comb-project" />).  So how does the reduced version of the augmented matrix give us 
      clues as to the nature of the solution(s)?  Let's investigate this here from both a numerical and 
      geometric point of view.

    Now that we can see that there are scenarios where we can have more than one solution to a system of equations,

    Now that we have examined several possible scenarios with respect to solutions to a system of equations, it 
    begins to make sense what is happening both symbolically and geometrically when it comes to solutions.  We 
    can define what it means to be a solution in the following way.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <definition xml:id="def-solution">
      <title>Solution of a Linear System</title>
      
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>solution</term> to a linear system of equations is simply a set of values,
          <m>\left\{s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots, s_n\right\}</m>, (sometimes we express this as an ordered n-tuple of 
          the form, <m>\left(s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots, s_n\right)</m>), such that choosing these values for variables
          <m>x_1=s_1, x_2=s_2, x_3=s_3, \ldots, x_n=s_n</m> make all of the equations in the system true at the 
          same time.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the last several activities, the solutions to systems have suggested some common conclusions when it comes 
    to the nature of these solutions.
  </p>
  
  <proposition xml:id="prop-possible-solution-types">
    <title>Solutions to Systems of Linear Equations</title>
    
    <p>
      Given a set of linear equations, there are only the following three possibilities for solutions to the 
      system:
      <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          There is exactly one solution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          There are infinitely many solutions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          There are no solutions.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
  </proposition>

  <p>
    As we begin to charaterize the solutions to a system of equations, we are really attempting to describe 
    the set in terms of some sort of visual regularity where the solutions (or points) "live".  For example, in 
    the previous activities, we could see geometrically for a 3D system that we could have a single <em>point</em> 
    (solution) where all three planes intersect (i.e. solves all three equations at once).  We could also 
    have the situation where all three planes intersect in a <em>line</em> giving infinitely many points or 
    solutions to the system.  For the 3D system, we can have still another type of situation yielding 
    infinitely many solutions.  What if all three equations form planes that are literally on top of each other?  
    This would mean that any point in that 2-dimensional plane would be a solution (not just along a single line).  
    Since there are also infinitely many points in a plane this would fall into category 2 of 
    <xref ref="prop-possible-solution-types" />, but be a slightly different scenario than a line.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Since we want to distinguish among these possibilities and describe where these solutions "live", we 
    decide to call this world where solutions exist their <term>solution space</term>.  For the type of 
    system in <xref ref="system-solve-no-solutions"/>, we noted that there are no places where all three planes 
    intersect and so the space that describes this set of solutions is <term>empty</term>.  If we want to 
    allow a single equation with all coefficients, 0, <m>0x_1+0x_2+0x_3=0</m>, here any point (solution) 
    consisting of three real numbers, <m>\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right)</m> will work and thus all of 
    <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> provides a solution.
  </p>

  
  <p>
    <definition xml:id="def-solution-space">
      <title>Solution Space</title>
      
      <statement>
        <p>
          We call the set of all sets, <m>\left\{s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots, s_n\right\}</m>, or put another way, 
          points, <m>\left(s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots, s_n\right)</m>, that satisify the system 
          of equations the <term>solution space</term>.  Note that in our examples of 3 equations in 3 variables, 
          these 3-tuples were physically represented as points in 3-dimensional space.  The 
          <term>solution space</term> could be simply a single point or possibly an infinite number of points 
          forming a line or other geometric object (in 3D, a plane).

    <title>Reduced Row Echelon Form</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Recall that in <xref ref="stripping-variables" />, we focused on getting an augmented matrix into 
      <em>upper triangular form</em>.  In particular, toward the end of this process, we tried to make 
      back-solving easier by making sure that the coefficient of the lead position (variable) in each row was 1 
      and that the rows toward the bottom had successively more zeros moving from left to right.  
      We refer to this structure of the matrix as <term>row echelon form</term> and give the following definition 
      to explicitly describe what we mean.

            A matrix is in <term>row echelon form</term> if it meets the following three criteria.

                  If the matrix has any rows that consist of all zeros, these rows appear at the bottom of the matrix.

                  If we choose any two successive rows starting from the top, the lead entry of the lower row

                  pattern.

    In the previous activities, we tried to get matrices into row echelon form so that we can more easily 
    back-solve, but you may have noticed that after a matrix is in <em>row echelon form</em>, there can still 
    be further reductions that could be done.  This next activity examines ways this might be done and some 
    limitations to this process.

            Since the first and second columns contain zeros in the last two rows, we cannot multiply the 
            second or thrid rows by a scalar and add them to the first row to place zeros in either of the 
            first two positions of the first row (we are stuck with the 1 and 4 in those positions).  However, 
            the second row has a 1 and -1 in the third and fourth positions, respectively.  This means we could 
            use the second row to further reduce the third or fourth positions in first row to zero.  This would 
            make back-solving even easier when the time comes.

    The dilemma we encountered in <xref ref="act-matrix-reduce-rref" /> raises an interesting question.  How far 
    can we reduce a matrix before further manipulation with row operations begins to screw up entries we have 
    already reduced to zero entries?  This question prompts us to refine our idea of 
    <term>row echelon form</term> leading to a definition of what we call <term>reduced row echelon form</term> 
    by adding one additional criteria to our <term>row echelon form</term> definition 
    (<xref ref="def-row-echelon-form" />).

          A matrix is in <term>reduced row echelon form</term> if it meets the following four criteria.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <term>Zeros at the Bottom</term>
              </p>
              <p>
                If the matrix has any rows that consist of all zeros, these rows appear at the bottom of the matrix.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>

              </p>
              <p>
                The first nonzero entry in each nonzero row (aka the "lead entry") is a 1. These leading 
                entries are also called <term>pivots</term>.

                If we choose any two successive rows starting from the top, the lead entry of the lower row 
                is to the right of the lead entry of the higher row. This creates a "staggered"  or "stairstep"

    From a visual sense, a matrix that is in reduced row echelon form would look something like
    <me>
      \left[
      \begin{array}{ccccc}
      1 \amp 0 \amp * \amp 0 \amp * \\
      0 \amp 1 \amp * \amp 0 \amp * \\
      0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp * \\
      0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0
     \end{array}
    \right]
    </me>
    where the *'s could be any real numbers.  Notice that the pivots are staggered and the lead entries of 1 in 
    each row are always to the right of the lead entries of the rows above them.  In addition, all entries 
    in the column above and below a pivot are always zero.

    When your spy in part (d) of <xref ref="act-uniqueness-rref"/> came back from looking at the results of 
    reduced row echelon forms from the other groups, you may have been surprised that they were all the same.  
    This leads us to a remarkable theorem regarding the reduced row echelon form (rref) of any matrix.  Your 
    observation of the uniqueness of the rref will play an important role in finding vectors that are 
    "essential" for a set to have in order to span a space and which ones are "redundant".
