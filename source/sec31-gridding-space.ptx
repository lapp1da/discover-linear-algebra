  <title>Bases and the Way We Grid Space</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    In this section we look at how we can grid space in many different ways and how we can move between these 
    gridding systems.  Recall from <xref ref="act-descartes-fly" />, we used two different gridding systems 
    to describe the location of a fly on the ceiling.

    You will also recall that in <xref ref="linear-comb-project" /> we explored how many vectors we needed for 
    linear combinations of these vectors to describe a location in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>.  In particular, we found 
    that if we had three or more vectors that were linearly indepndent in pairs, we did not need them all.  We 
    only needed two linearly independent vectors to be able to describe any location in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> 
    with a linear combination of them.

    At this point, we want to explore how different ways of gridding a space can have different advantages and 
    disadvantages.  From <xref ref="act-descartes-fly" />, we had saw each of two grid systems as well as these 
    superimposed on each other.
