<div class="para">Since the first and second columns contain zeros in the last two rows, we cannot multiply the second or thrid rows by a scalar and add them to the first row to place zeros in either of the first two positions of the first row (we are stuck with the 1 and 4 in those positions).  However, the second row has a 1 and -1 in the third and fourth positions, respectively.  This means we could use the second row to further reduce the third or fourth positions in first row to zero.  This would make back-solving even easier when the time comes.</div> <div class="para">Using row operations with row 2, try to reduce this matrix further to place a zero in the first row at the third position.
