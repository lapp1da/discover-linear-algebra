  "body": " This book is an application of research I have conducted on the teaching and learning of linear algebra with my colleagues and friends, the late Dr. Melvin Nyman from Alma College, and Dr. John Berry of the University of Plymouth in the UK. As we conducted research together on students in linear algebra classes, I so valued our stimulating conversations and genuine friendship. I could not have created this text without the insights they shared as we analyzed our data and crafted our journal articles. As Mel was only a few miles away from Central Michigan University, I truly miss my frequent visits to his campus. While Mel is no longer with us, his influence on my thinking and teaching are still an ever present reminder of a great friend and mathematician. While John is still active in working to inspire the mathematically talented youth of the UK, I do miss the opportunity to engage with him for the sake of my own professional development. His ideas always prompted deeper understanding for me and I cherish our work together.  I would also like to thank my friend and colleague, Dr. Tibor Marcinek, for his wise counsel and contributions to the text. Tibor was especially helpful in contributing GeoGebra sketches to the activities and helping me better design my earlier versions of my dynamic sketches.  "

  "title": "Modeling Data and Moving Between Worlds",
  "body": " Modeling Data and Moving Between Worlds  In this section we will look at linear algebra as a way to encode information and operate on it allowing us to move between different sets of information. To this end, we will define how matrices and vectors are operated on with binary operations like addition and multiplication. While multiplication of matrices may seem weird at first, you will see that it is defined as it is for convenience in manipulating data and transforming different types of values into other computed values based on them. We begin by considering a case where we want to move between a pricing scheme and the revenue it generates for three different companies with three different sets of orders of our products.  To accomplish this, we will use constructs created to deal with objects that contain multiple entries. In the scenario we are using where companies place orders for products, we want to encode the numerical values for the orders organizing them according to the product and company placing the order. Here just want to reduce the information to an array of values and so we define a matrix as an array of values (or objects) consisting of rows and columns. We typically contain these values with brackets or parentheses like: In the matrices above, the columns could represent the numbers of each of four products being ordered and the rows could represent the three different companies placing the orders (see the table of orders for this situation given in Table 1.1.1).  We also define a vector as matrix with a single column such as or . Note that we are using boldface to denote the names of the vectors for convenience to distinguish them from numerical objects that we call scalars . In a text like this, using boldface makes sense in print, but typically, in written work, we use a harpoon over the name since boldface is not practical with a pen. In this case, we would write the names as or respectively.  You may have encountered vectors before in geometry or physics. We will go into greater detail later with respect to the geometric interpretation, but for now, the behavior remains the same in that operations still work as they do in geometry and physics. Essentially, vectors consist of components so that when the vectors are added, we simply add the components.     If and are vectors, we define vector addition as adding the vectors component by component. Note that the vectors must be of the same dimension.      For example, suppose we have the two vectors in , . Adding these would result in .  The other basic operation we can do with vectors is to scale them (geometrically make them longer or shorter or in the case of negative values, make them go in the opposite direction). For this reason, when we multiply the vector by a numerical value, we call that value a scalar . For example, In essence, we scaled the vector by a factor of 2.     In general, we can define scalar multiplication of a vector as where .     Combining scalar multiplication with vector addition, we get We can use these linear combinations applying them to our previous scenario for moving between price of materials and the revenue they generate.   Linear Combinations and Dealing with Data  Continuing our scenario from the introduction. Suppose that a supplier provides four different products with prices, , to three companies. One thing we may want to do is to play with pricing schemes and look at the generated revenue we would get from each of the three companies. Suppose we have orders from the three companies for each of our four products as given in the table below.    Product Orders    Clients  Product 1  Product 2  Product 3  Product 4    Company 1  14  9  34  41    Company 2  32  7  12  52    Company 3  21  8  5  23        Prices, Vectors, and Revenue   Consider the scenario given above for the orders by three companies for four different products.     Thinking of the four Products from Table 1.1.1 as each being a vector where the entries of the vector store the orders made for each of the three companies, express this information as a set of four vectors in .    Since there are four Products , we can express the orders from the three companies for each Product as an ordered triple (or vector) containing three entries (one for each company) for that product. This would give us a set of four vectors:       If Product 1 is priced at $12, Product 2 is priced at $9, Product 3 is priced at $15, and Product 4 is priced at $7, using these prices for each of the four Products in the table as scalars, write a linear combination of the vectors from your set from part (a) that when added will give a vector in that represents the revenue generated from each company. How much did you collect from each company? Feel free to use your CAS to do the computation here.     This means we received $1046 from Company 1, $991 from Company 2, and $560 from Company 3.      Since you allowed your CAS to do the computation for part (b), let's think about how it is doing the arithmetic. Using what we have defined for combining scalar multiplication and vector addition in Equation 1.1.2, show the details of how the CAS was computing the resulting vector that you obtained in part (b).              In general, we can think of the selling price for each of the four Products as scalars . Give a general expression in terms of for the revenue generated by the purchases for the three companies expressing them as a linear combination of three-entry revenue vectors (one entry for each company) resulting in the revenue vector, .           Notice that where the product and sum are combined in part (c) we have the scalar values (or prices) of each Product ($12, $9, $15, and $7) being multipled by all entries in their respective vectors where the number of orders of each Product is placed in the vector in order by the company. When these vectors are then added, we get the total revenue for each company organized as an ordered triple (since there are three companies).  Here we are purposefully using an example where the number of entries in each set of values of interest (prices and revenue) are different to highlight that although we can have the same number of entries in each set be the same, it is not necessary. Eventually we will express the prices as a vector consisting of four entries and the revenue as a vector consisting of three entries where we can think of the process of going from prices to revenue as a transformation between worlds so to speak. In this case we will have four entries in one set of vectors\/world (prices of different Products) meaning that these vectors exist in such as and three entries in the other set of vectors\/world (revenue from each of the three companies) existing in like .  In the previous activity, you may have noticed behaviors of the arithmetic when working with the vectors and scalars that are familiar. From your basic experiences in elementary school, you will recall some properties for operating on numbers that seem to also be happening in your work with vectors. Let's explore these briefly by using the properties of vector addition and scalar multiplication we have just defined.    Structure of Vectors   Consider the vectors , , and . Define each of these vectors in your computer algebra system (CAS).     Based on what we know about how we have defined vector addition and the fact that all of these vectors are in , when we add any two of them we will get another vector in . However, what other properties hold? Using your CAS, compute and then compute . Describe what you notice? Have you seen this behavior before with real numbers? What is this property called?      Using your CAS, compute , first by computing and then adding to your result. Now compute , first by computing and then adding your result to . Describe what you notice?

Have you seen this behavior before with real numbers? What is this property called?      Using each of the vectors, , , and , negate each entry of and add the resulting vector to . Describe what you notice. Repeat this process with and . Do you get similar results? Have you seen this behavior before with real numbers? What is this property called?      Using your CAS, compute , first by computing and then multiplying 2 times your result. Now compute , first by computing 2 times each vector and then adding your results together. Describe what you notice? Have you seen this behavior before with real numbers? What is this property called?      Given that , compute and . Describe what you notice? Have you seen this behavior before with real numbers? What is this property called?      Using your CAS, compute , first by computing and then multiplying 2 times your result. Now compute , first by computing 2 times 3 and then multiplying your result by . Describe what you notice? Have you seen this behavior before with real numbers? What is this property called?      Since we have seen these properties before from our work with real numbers, we can use them with vectors and scalars so that we can manipulate these combinations of operations. To this end, we can define a \"world\" where objects like vectors and scalars behave in a way that we expect and can use.    Vector Space   A vector space is a nonempty set of objects, called vectors , on which are defined two operations, called addition and scalar multiplication (for real numbers), that satisfy the following axioms. For any and :                  There exists a zero vector , denoted , such that .    For each , there exists a vector denoted such that .    The scalar multiple of by , denoted .                              Transforming Data and Matrix Multiplication  As we have seen, we can use vectors to represent any entity that might have multiple components. This allows us to manipulate values of common components by adding or multiplying them while keeping the components separated in the process. This use of linear combinations of vectors is useful, but the real desire of the previous scenario is to examine how manipulating one set of values (say, prices of products) affects another set of values (revenue from each company). Just as we explored functional relationships in algebra and calculus, we also might want to explore functional relationships with objects that have not just one value as an input and one corresponding value as an output, but rather inputs that have many component values and a corresponding output that also has many component values.  Recall that one of our first experiences with functions dealt with simple linear relationships. For example, Hooke's Law states that there is a simple linear relationship between force on a stretched or compressed spring and the distance of the associated stretch or compression, , where is a constant of proportionality. If we use function notation to express that force, , is a function of stretch, , we indicate the independent variable by placing it in parentheses getting, .  In this situation, we obtain the force as an output by multiplying the stretch, , by a numerical value, . What if in our scenario for the relationship between pricing of products and the revenue generated from each of our three companies, we could have a simple multiplication by something that acted like in our Hooke's Law relationship? In the case, there is a single value, , that affects the output, , for a given input, . However, in the situation with price vs revenue, there are many values impacting the output of revenue for an input vector of prices (namely, all of the different order values provided by the companies placing orders). So, our k -equivalent must take into account all of the values of the orders placed by the companies. Here we can think of our single multiplier (like that of ) as being comprised of an array of order values for the products like we had for the linear combination of the vectors except now we express this set of vectors as a single matrix where each column is a vector (called a column vector ). This gives an entity (matrix) that serves the role that did in .  What this does for us is it allows us to think of the scalars (prices) we used in the linear combination, as an input vector, , so that we get a relationship that is structurally similar to : where acts like , acts like , and acts like .  The use of a matrix as a single entity that we can use to multiply by a vector brings an interesting question. What does it mean to multiply by a matrix? If we look at what we want to do from our functional perspective in the case above, we would like to have the outputs represent the revenue in the way we ultimately added them up in the linear combination of the vectors with the prices viewed as scalars for the column vectors in the matrix. This means that we will need to define the multiplication of a matrix and a vector in such a way that we get:  Now this may seem complicated, but one way to look at the process is that we proceed across a row in the matrix while moving down the vector component by component adding the products of the row entries of the matrix and the corresponding component entries of the vector. For example, for the top entry in the resulting revenue vector, we obtained it by moving across the first row with values 14, 9, 34, and 41, while multiplying each by their respective position price value , , , and and then adding these four products together. This gives . Now we proceed similarly for each row moving across the row and down the vector creating product combinations and adding them together as we go. The row of the matrix we use for the computation becomes the row position in the resulting vector we are creating (in this case, revenue). You will likely notice that the result of the way we have chosen to define the multiplication of a matrix and a vector only makes sense if the number of columns of the matrix matches the number of entries (rows of components) of the vector.    Transformations of Vectors  Now that we have defined what it means to multiply a matrix and a vector, we can go back to the concept that motivated it, namely, the desire to move between an input vector and an output vector. In a way, we are looking to transform one type of vector into another type of vector. When we think of our example of Hooke's Law as transforming stretch or compression into force, we note that this happens in our daily lives and we are not often even aware it is there.  Consider a trip to the grocery store. In the produce aisle, we take zucchini and place them on a scale. In turn, the scale returns a weight (force) in pounds (if you are in the USA) or mass in kilograms (practically anywhere else in the world). Inside the scale, there is a spring that is being compressed or stretched. This value is then transformed into a value of weight or mass using Hooke's Law. In fact, it is more likely the case that you are more familiar with a transformation in form of cost instead of weight or mass as most digital scales today allow us to scan the scale's output barcode registering a cost in our \"shop and scan\" app. Below is a video illustrating this process.  -----------INSERT VIDEO HERE--------------  So what are the characteristics of this type of transformation? Consider the case from the video where we saw that the doubling the force (or mass) corresponded in the doubling of the stretch. Similarly, tripling the force would triple the stretch. In general, this means that any multiple of stretch will correspond to the same multiple of force (or mass or cost) depending on the output we desire for the transformation. We can see this from the basic algebra from Hooke's Law. What this says is that scalar multiplication is preserved .  Now this is all well and good if we are looking at replicating the same stretch multiple times (e.g. all of our zucchini are the exact same weight), but what about the case where we have multiple numbers of zucchini of varying weight (corresponding to varying stretches)? We also want to have it be the case that if we place two different \"stretch\" zucchinis on the scale that the resulting weight will simply be added together as well so that their corresponding costs will also be added together (since we are paying based on the cost\/unit weight). In this case, suppose we have two possibly different stretches , and . Here we get What this says is that vector addition is preserved . In this case, we can think of the inputs, and , as vectors with only one component. In fact, if you have ever taken a physics class, you will recall that both force and stretch in Hook'e Law were considered vectors since along a single line we associate a positive and negative direction for these values to indicate direction of the force or stretch. We often represent this relationship as a vector relationship, or .  Recall from your Algebra 1 days, a function like is the most basic of linear functions. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that these two aspects of behavior (preservation of scalar multiplication and vector addition) by this type of function are the defining properties of what we call linear transformations .     In the case of the force and spring stretch, we had a spring constant, , as our constant of proportionality where it was a single value that worked for a specific spring. As we have seen, we may have relationships where this \"constant\" is actually dependent on many different values instead of a single one (i.e. a matrix of values). Can we still have these two operations (scalar multiplication and vector addition) work when the thing we are multiplying the vectors by is a matrix? Suppose we have a matrix transformation given by . Define this transformation in your CAS and then define and .    Defining Transformation on TI-Nspire CX II CAS   Defining on TI-Nspire CX II CAS        Compute and and add them.      Compute and .

Does your earlier observation hold for any two vectors in ? Explain.      Using, , to represent any real number, find expressions for and . Does your observation from part (c) hold for all vectors in ? Explain.      Given how we defined matrix-vector multiplication out of linear combiinations, come up with an argument for why all such matrix transformations must be  preserving both scalar multiplication and vector addition.        Linear Transformation   Suppose is a mapping between and , ( and need not be distinct) such that both scalar multiplication and vector addition are preserved.  where , and is a scalar. Then the mapping is called linear or a linear transformation .     Just as the relationship of Hooke's Law can be thought of as transforming stretch into force , in our scenario between pricing structures and the revenue generated, we are similarly looking to transform a pricing scheme into the resulting revenue for our three companies. We can even use function notation to represent this relationship. If we let the vector , we can think of the product of the matrix of orders by the companies and the vector as a revenue transformation (or function), , given by This is effectively a mapping between vectors in and vectors in . We can represent this mapping as .    Price to Revenue: Linear Transformation?   In the previous activity, we illustrated how we can show that a matrix transformation between the same spaces ( to ) is, in fact, a linear transformation. In this activity, let's take a similar approach to show we can also make the same claim for mappings between different spaces ( to ). Here we will use our earlier example of transforming price scenarios into revenues for our three companies.     Consider the transformation , where . Find expressions for and .

If is a linear transformation, then it must map the zero vector from the domain to the zero vector in the range. In other words, .    Suppose is a linear transformation and . Well since , we know that . Since vector addition is preserved, we get that this is equal to . Again, as a linear transformation, we know that scalar multiplication is also preserved and so and thus where here is in .     We began this section looking at how we can represent practical data and relationships using matrices and vectors along with operations allowing us to transform one type of vector into another. In the next few sections, we will extend this view to consider geometric representations that have far reaching applications into areas such as digital file compression and image detection. Eveytime you access your phone using facial recognition, you are using linear algebra. Vectors and matrices play a key role in your everyday life and you may not even be aware of it!   "

As I was staring at the ceiling while visiting Caveland Lodge in Carter Caves State Park located in Olive Hill, KY, I was reminded of the story of the mathematician and philosopher, Rene Descartes. As the story goes, the mathematician, Descartes, was watching a fly walking on the ceiling. He wondered how he might describe the position of the fly and decided that he could measure the distance from the corner of the ceiling in one direction and then the distance along a perpendicular direction to uniquely locate the fly (much like the grid system you can see in the image of my hotel room ceiling at Carter Caves, Figure 2.1.1). This was the beginning of the Cartesian (or rectangular) coordinate system. However, this is not the only way we could uniquely locate the fly.     Carter Caves State Park   Descartes Fly     Descartes' Fly   Descartes Fly       Linear Combinations and Spanning     Suppose you are Descartes staring at the fly on the ceiling. At first, all you see is the fly sitting arbitrarily in space (see Figure 2.1.2). Next, you imagine two vectors defining different directions and acting as units of measure (Figure 2.1.3). As your imagination wanders, you begin to see two sets of parallel lines crisscrossing the ceiling (Figure 2.1.4).      Fly on Ceiling      Fly and Vectors      Fly and Grid         If the vectors, and , represent the units of measure in their respective directions, and where these two vectors both begin is the origin of your grid system, what would be the coordinates of the fly in the coordinate system?      Draw a vector from the origin (where and meet) to the fly. Describe this new resultant vector as a linear combination of the vectors and .      At this point you blink your eyes and imagine a new pair of vectors acting as your measuring devices. This time they are the standard unit vectors you are used to seeing from the Cartesian plane, namely, and . Based on the grid system you see in Figure 2.1.7, what are the coordinates of the fly's location?      Fly on Ceiling      Fly and Grid      Fly and Both Grids          Draw a vector from the origin (where and meet) to the fly. Describe this new resultant vector as a linear combination of the vectors and .      Looking at both grids superimposed on each other (Figure 2.1.8), explain why your responses to parts (a) and (c) make sense.      Looking at the scalars from the linear combination of vectors you found in parts (b) and (d), what connections do you see to the grid systems being used in each case?      As we have just seen, there are several (in fact, infinitely many) ways we could grid the space to describe a way to get to a location in . We happened to be using two vectors in each case in the previous activity, one with and , and the other with vectors from our more familiar \"standard\" two vectors, and . However, could we go with fewer vectors? What about using more than two? Let's consider what might happen in either of these cases.    Linear Combinations and Spanning   As we have seen by the operations we have defined for vectors, we can create new vectors using combinations of scalar multiplication and addition of existing vectors. In this lab you will explore both the algebraic and geometric combination of such vectors and develop an intuition for how algebraic operations relate to geometric representations of the same ideas.    Linear Combinations     Instructions   This interactive construction provides, initially, two vectors displayed head-to-toe representing a linear combination. The numerical entries for each vector can be changed by simply editing their respective values in the fields provided. For eaxample, to change vector , edit the values for and . In addition, there are sliders provided for the scalars associated with the vectors. Manipulating the vectors and scalars allows you to create various linear combinations using the displayed vectors. Later in the project, you will be asked to use three vectors instead of two. To add the third vector, simply click the \"three vectors\" checkbox.                   Consider the two vectors and . On page 1.1 of the TI-Nspire document, LinearComb.tns, these vectors have been defined for you. On page 1.2, you will see two sliders representing scalars ( and ) along with the geometric representation of the linear combination of these vectors using the scalar values (i.e. ).  You may instead use the applet in Figure 2.1.9 where the components of the vectors can be entered directly into the fields labeled , , , and and the scalars are given by the sliders and above.    Part 1 Items    On page 1.2, adjust the sliders to find scalars and so that the linear combination of the vectors and will be the same as the vector . Record the values of the scalars you find giving a rough sketch of your linear combination.    Don't worry if your decimal answers are a little off here. It should, however, be in the ballpark.      On page 1.1, perform the computation for the values of and that you found and discuss what you notice relative to your experience on the graphing page.    Again, don't worry if your decimal answers are a little off here. It should, however, be in the ballpark.      Is it possible to find a different pair of values and that will also result in the linear combination being equal to the vector ? If so, what values for and did you find? If not, explain why it was not possible.      Now grab the point on page 1.2 representing the vector and move it to another location in the plane. Find a new set of scalars and so that the linear combination of the vectors, , will be the same as your new vector. Record the new vector you choose along with the scalars and that work for the linear combination giving a rough sketch of your linear combination.      Repeat part (d) for at least two more vectors recording your new vectors and the scalars and that work for the linear combination giving a rough sketch of your linear combinations.      If we start with a certain set of fixed vectors and look at all of the vectors we can get (or reach) with just linear combinations of these vectors ( ), it is like asking what objects can we grab with our arms? Thus we call the set of all vectors that we can reach with linear combinations of a certain set of vectors the Span of those vectors (analogous to our “arm span”). In this case we would denote the set of all vectors that we can obtain from linear combinations of and by .         Choose two new vectors to use for vectors and redefining them on page 1.1 (be careful to choose entries that will allow the vectors to fit into the graphing window). While on page 1.1, you can choose menu option followed by to redefine the vectors. To enter the desired new vectors, use the math palette and select the vector option (see below).  If using Figure 2.1.9, simply edit the entries in the fields for the vector components to redefine the vectors and .            Part 2 Items    Repeat what you did in question 1(d) recording the third vector and the scalars and that work for the linear combination giving a rough sketch of your linear combination.      Now place your target vector back to and redefine the vector . Now try to define another vector for so that it is not possible to reach the vector with any linear combination of vectors and . What do you notice about the geometric relationship between and ?      Based on your experiences, given any two vectors in , can you always find a linear combination of them that will give you any vector in you might desire? Explain your observations.      At this point we have examined linear combinations of two vectors to get another vector in . What if we used linear combinations of three vectors? For the next part of the lab, consider three original vectors , , and using linear combination to obtain a fourth vector as you did in the first two questions.        If using the TI-Nspire, on page 2.1 of the document, you can see three vectors , , and defined. This part of the project will use three vectors instead of two.  If you are using the built-in applet (Figure 2.1.9), simply click the checkbox to show the third vector.            Part 3 Items    If using the TI-Nspire, go to page 2.2 and adjust the scalars , , and so that you get vector as a linear combination of vectors , , and .  If using Figure 2.1.8, move the resultant vector to and adjust the scalars , , and so that you get vector as a linear combination of vectors , , and .  Record your values for , , and giving a rough sketch of your linear combination.      Can you find a different set of scalars , , and so that you also get vector as a linear combination of vectors , , and ? If so, record your different set of values for , , and that work giving a rough sketch of your linear combination. If not, explain why it can't happen.      Compare\/contrast the “uniqueness” of the linear combination in the case of three vectors to what you found in question 1(c) for two vectors.             Based on what you found in question 3, is it possible to replace the three-vector situation with a unique linear combination of two vectors? To help answer this question, try leaving alone and finding a unique second vector that could be used instead of so that when added to would give the vector . Give a rough sketch of your linear combination.          Based on your observations, what do you think would be the minimum number of vectors needed so that you could reach any desired vectors in as a linear combination of the vectors? What relationship must there be among these vectors so that any vector in can be obtained as a linear combination of them?       Linear Independence  As we saw in Project 2.1.2, we had a few different situations that could occur in dealing with vectors in . If we only have one vector, it is easily seen that we can only move along a single line containing that vector by use of scalar multiples of it. If we have exactly two vectors, we can have a couple of scenarios. The first happens when the two vectors are just scalar multiples of each other. In this case, adding them together in any linear combination will simply result in staying on the same line, and thus, we cannot move into other parts of the plane. We can't get off the line. The second scenario is if we have two vectors that are not scalar multiples of each other. In this case, using scalar multiples of one of them allows us to move along an infinite line and when adding a scalar multiple of the other vector, we can veer off that course into other regions of the plane. In fact, to span all of , we need to have at least two vectors that are not scalar multiples of each other.  The last scenario is when we had more than two vectors in . Recall that in this case, we could replace some of these vectors with a single vector representing their sum and thus \"reduce\" the number of vectors we needed to span the same space. To see how this works algebraically, let's explore it with some actual vectors.     Based on Project 2.1.2, we noticed that if we are in , if we want to span the entire space, we need to have at least two vectors. However, it was not enough to have two vectors, but in addition, these two vectors could not be on the same line. Here we will explore this idea in greater detail. Consider the set of vectors in given by .     Do we need all three of these vectors to reach all of ? If so, explain why. If not, explain why not.      Consider the linear combination of these vectors given by . Express the vector as a scalar multiple of .      Now replace the part of your linear combination, , with its equivalent expression in terms of . Based on your experience working with polynomials in high school, \"factor out\" the vector from the last two terms of your linear combination. What is the new scalar you get for ?      Now you can take your original linear combination in three vectors given by and replace it with a linear combination of only two vectors, namely and . What is this linear combination?      Using your CAS, evaluate both and your new linear combination from part (d) to show they are the same.      In the previous case, we happened to have one vector that was a scalar multiple of another vector, but what happens if none of the three vectors are scalar multiples of another one of the three? Suppose instead, that one of the vectors is a linear combination of the other two? Consider the set of three vectors . Here we do not necessarily have one that is a scalar multiple of another, but let's say that . Since our assumption here is that none of the three vectors is a scalar multiple of any of the remaining ones, we can pick any two vectors and reach any other vector in since they do not fall on the same line and thus will span all of the plane. Therefore, we can assume that one of the three vectors must be a linear combination of the other two. If we want to have a particular linear combination using all three vectors, , we can instead represent this as . This gives . In otherwords, a linear combination using just and , meaning we only need two vectors since one of the three is linearly dependent on the other two. Since we can use this argument for all three vectors, this also confirms your observations from part 3 of Project 2.1.2 that given three vectors where no two share a common line, a linear combination used to reach another vector is not unique.    A set of vectors is linearly dependent if one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of other vectors in the set. Otherwise, the set of vectors is called linearly independent .    Now you may have a question about what to do with a set of vectors containing only one nonzero vector? Based on our definition, we can't really say that one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of other vectors (we don't have \"other\" vectors). Therefore, we will consider this situation as falling into the \"otherwise\" category and state that a set of exactly one nonzero vector is a linearly independent set.   "
